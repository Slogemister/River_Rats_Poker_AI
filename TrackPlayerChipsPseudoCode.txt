During the betting round:

GET a list of hand actions (getHandActions) of the current round, leading up to point of the current player acting called playerActions.

CREATE an initial list of active players in the hand (whosIn) called activePlayers
CREATE an initial list chip values that each player has put in the pot called playerValues

FROM each item of playerActions:
	READ the current list item to determine...
		WHAT player is this 
		WHAT action did the player do
	
	IF the current player is in activePlayers:
		IF the player's action is to FOLD:
			UPDATE this player's status to not be included in upper if statement
		ELSE: (player called/bet)
			FIND the current table pot (getTablePot)
			UPDATE value of money that player has put in to the pot so far
			
	ELSE: 
		(Do nothing for this player, only update chip values for active players)
		(Shouldn't reach this statement, but if it does, CONTINUE to the next list item)
